There is a Dispatcher which collects all shipments which arenâ€™t assigned to a warehouse
and collects all warehouses with their respective inventories. A Dispatch instance calls
allocate on the pending shipments collection. Allocate passes each shipment to assign.

Assign basically takes the shipment and the warehouse collection and compares the
zip code of each to find the nearest, then does an inventory check to see if the shipment
can be fulfilled. 

If it can, the shipment gets assigned that warehouse id and process is called with the 
warehouse id and shipment line items. Process goes through each line item and finds
the respective warehouse inventory and decreases by the line item amount.

It it cannot be fulfilled, reallocate is called with the shipment. This breaks the shipment
line items into their own shipment with only themselves as line items. These new
shipments are then assigned in the same process stated above. In the case there is not
enough quantity in a single warehouse, these shipments are added to errors on the
model instance.

Potentially build out a partials feature which takes full orders and breaks them down into
fillable quantities and then assigns those new shipments to warehouses.
